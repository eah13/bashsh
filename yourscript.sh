## Your first Script


##
## This script will do 3 things when it's done:
## 1 - display all of your history items containing a certain command
## 2 - display all lines of a text file containing a certain command
## 3 - any UNIX command of your choice
##

## The comments will give you clues and tell you how to order things but you'll do all the work.


## CHOOSE
##   This section asks the user for their choice of 1, 2 or 3

echo "Choose what function you want"
echo " 1 - search your history"
echo " 2 - search a file"
echo " 3 - "                    # TODO: Fill this in with your command
echo
echo "Select 1, 2 or 3: "
read CHOICE 

## OK, from here on you'll have to finish the script.  Follow the comments and fill in more code:

##
## If CHOICE is 1, read in a COMMAND and display history items
##


##
## If CHOICE is 2, read in a COMMAND and  a FILE and search FILE for COMMAND
##

##
## If CHOICE is 3, execute any UNIX command of your choice
##
